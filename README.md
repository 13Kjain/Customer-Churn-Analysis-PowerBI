### End-to-End Customer Churn Analysis

This project represents a comprehensive, end-to-end data science workflow to analyze and predict customer churn within a telecom dataset. It showcases a full project lifecycle from data preparation to predictive modeling and visualization, demonstrating a practical application of analytics to solve a real-world business problem.

### Project Highlights
* **Data Engineering:** Performed an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process and data cleaning using **SQL Server** to prepare the dataset for analysis.
* **Business Intelligence:** Created an interactive and insightful dashboard in **Power BI** to visualize key drivers of customer churn and business impact.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Developed a supervised machine learning model using Python's **Random Forest** algorithm, achieving a robust **85% accuracy** in predicting customer attrition.
* **Strategic Insights:** Integrated model predictions back into Power BI to provide forward-looking insights and actionable recommendations for customer retention.

### Technologies Used
* **Database:** SQL Server
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI
* **Machine Learning:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
* **Environment:** Google Colab

### Project Structure
* `Churn Analysis.pbix`: The main Power BI file with all reports and dashboards.
* `Churn Prediction.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the Random Forest model.
* `Customer_Data.csv`: The original dataset used for this analysis.
